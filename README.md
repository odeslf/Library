# RESTful Library API ðŸ“š


This project is a straightforward RESTful API built with Spring Boot, designed to manage books and authors within an online library system. It serves as a study project, focusing on implementing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, handling entity relationships, and demonstrating best practices for exception handling and testing.
